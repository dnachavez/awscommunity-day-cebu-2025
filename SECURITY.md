# Security Policy for AWS Community Day - Cebu Roadshow 2025

The organizing team and community take the security of our event website seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and our community members to help us keep our project safe.

## Supported Versions

Since this is a website for a specific event, only the latest version deployed and the code in the `main` branch are supported.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `main`  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We encourage you to report vulnerabilities privately to give us time to address them before they become public.

### Option 1: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (Preferred)

The best way to report a vulnerability is directly through GitHub's private reporting feature.
- Navigate to the **"Security"** tab of our repository.
- Click on **"Report a vulnerability"** on the left-hand side.
- This will open a private channel to our maintainers.

### Option 2: Email

If you prefer, you can send an email to our private security alias:
**`awscloudclubctu@gmail.com`**

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us resolve the issue quickly, please provide as much detail as possible:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Clear, step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or screen recordings.
- Your name and a link (e.g., Twitter or GitHub profile) if you would like to be publicly credited for your discovery.

### Our Commitment (Disclosure Process)

If you report a vulnerability in good faith and follow this policy:

1.  We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **72 hours**.
2.  We will investigate your report and confirm the issue. We'll keep you updated on our progress.
3.  We will work on a fix in a private branch.
4.  Once the fix is deployed, we will notify you.
5.  With your permission, we will be happy to publicly credit you for your contribution.

We are a volunteer-run team, and we appreciate your patience as we work to address reported issues. Thank you for helping us keep our community safe.
